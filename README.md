# Brain Tumor Detection System

## Overview
The **Brain Tumor Detection System** is a machine learning-based approach for detecting brain tumors from medical images using deep learning techniques. This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify MRI scans as tumorous or non-tumorous.

## Features
- Automated detection of brain tumors from MRI images.
- Uses deep learning techniques for accurate classification.
- Implements data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Provides visualizations of results and model performance metrics.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

## Model Architecture
The detection system employs a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with layers including:
- Convolutional Layers (feature extraction)
- Pooling Layers (dimensionality reduction)
- Fully Connected Layers (classification)
- Softmax Activation (output)

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the notebook.
2. Preprocess the data (resizing images, normalization, augmentation).
3. Train the deep learning model on the dataset.
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
5. Test with new MRI images for predictions.

## Results
The system provides:
- Classification accuracy of the trained model.
- Loss and accuracy plots.
- Sample predictions with corresponding labels.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more advanced deep learning architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG16).
- Improve dataset augmentation techniques.
- Deploy as a web application for real-time detection.
